######################### QUESTION 4 a/b/c ###########################
# There may be an association between gender and funding. But can we infer causation here?
#  Is gender bias causing this observed difference? The response to the original paper claims
#  that what we see here is similar to the UC Berkeley admissions example. Specifically they 
#  state that this "could be a prime example of Simpsonâ€™s paradox; if a higher percentage of
#  women apply for grants in more competitive scientific disciplines, then an analysis across
#  all disciplines could incorrectly show 'evidence' of gender inequality."

# To settle this dispute, use dataset 'dat' to check if this is a case of Simpson's paradox,
#  plot the success rates versus disciplines, which have been ordered by overall success, with
#  colors to denote the genders and size to denote the number of applications.
