## 1.2 Combinations and Permutations 

## Code: Introducing paste() and expand.grid()

# joining strings with paste
number <- "Three"
suit <- "Hearts"
paste(number, suit)

# joining vectors element-wise with paste
paste(letters[1:5], as.character(1:5))

# generating combinations of 2 vectors with expand.grid
expand.grid(pants = c("blue", "black"), shirt = c("white", "grey", "plaid"))

## Code: Generating a deck of cards

suits <- c("Diamonds", "Clubs", "Hearts", "Spades")
numbers <- c("Ace", "Deuce", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King")
deck <- expand.grid(number = numbers, suit = suits)
deck <- paste(deck$number, deck$suit)
deck

# probability of drawing a king
kings <- paste("King", suits)
mean(deck %in% kings)

## Code: Permutations and combinations

## Correction: The code shown does not generate all 7 digit phone numbers because phone numbers can have repeated digits. It generates all possible 7 digit numbers without repeats.

library(gtools)
permutations(5,2)    # ways to choose 2 numbers in order from 1:5
all_phone_numbers <- permutations(10, 7, v = 0:9)
n <- nrow(all_phone_numbers)
index <- sample(n, 5)
all_phone_numbers[index,]

permutations(3,2)    # order matters
combinations(3,2)    # order does not matter

## Code: Probability of drawing a second king given that one king is drawn

hands <- permutations(52,2, v = deck)
first_card <- hands[,1]
second_card <- hands[,2]
sum(first_card %in% kings)

sum(first_card %in% kings & second_card %in% kings) / sum(first_card %in% kings)

## Code: Probability of a natural 21 in blackjack

aces <- paste("Ace", suits)
facecard <- c("King", "Queen", "Jack", "Ten")
facecard <- expand.grid(number = facecard, suit = suits)
facecard <- paste(facecard$number, facecard$suit)

hands <- combinations(52, 2, v=deck) # all possible hands

# probability of a natural 21 given that the ace is listed first in `combinations`
mean(hands[,1] %in% aces & hands[,2] %in% facecard)

# probability of a natural 21 checking for both ace first and ace second
mean((hands[,1] %in% aces & hands[,2] %in% facecard)|(hands[,2] %in% aces & hands[,1] %in% facecard))

## Code: Monte Carlo simulation of natural 21 in blackjack

## Note that your exact values will differ because the process is random and the seed is not set.

# code for one hand of blackjack
hand <- sample(deck, 2)
hand

# code for B=10,000 hands of blackjack
B <- 10000
results <- replicate(B, {
  hand <- sample(deck, 2)
  (hand[1] %in% aces & hand[2] %in% facecard) | (hand[2] %in% aces & hand[1] %in% facecard)
})
mean(results)

## Code: The birthday problem

# checking for duplicated bdays in one 50 person group
n <- 50
bdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)    # generate n random birthdays
any(duplicated(bdays))    # check if any birthdays are duplicated

# Monte Carlo simulation with B=10000 replicates
B <- 100000
results <- replicate(B, {    # returns vector of B logical values
  bdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(bdays))
})
mean(results)    # calculates proportion of groups with duplicated bdays

## sapply

## Code: Function for birthday problem Monte Carlo simulations

## Note that the function body of compute_prob() is the code that we wrote in the previous video. If we write this code as a function, we can use sapply() to apply this function to several values of n.

# function to calculate probability of shared bdays across n people
compute_prob <- function(n, B = 10000) {
  same_day <- replicate(B, {
    bdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
    any(duplicated(bdays))
  })
  mean(same_day)
}

n <- seq(1, 60)

## Code: Element-wise operation over vectors and sapply

x <- 1:10
sqrt(x)    # sqrt operates on each element of the vector

y <- 1:10
x*y    # * operates element-wise on both vectors

compute_prob(n)    # does not iterate over the vector n without sapply

x <- 1:10
sapply(x, sqrt)    # this is equivalent to sqrt(x)

prob <- sapply(n, compute_prob)    # element-wise application of compute_prob to n
plot(n, prob)

## Code: Computing birthday problem probabilities with sapply

# function for computing exact probability of shared birthdays for any n
exact_prob <- function(n){
  prob_unique <- seq(365, 365-n+1)/365   # vector of fractions for mult. rule
  1 - prod(prob_unique)    # calculate prob of no shared birthdays and subtract from 1
}

# applying function element-wise to vector of n values
eprob <- sapply(n, exact_prob)

# plotting Monte Carlo results and exact probabilities on same graph
plot(n, prob)    # plot Monte Carlo results
lines(n, eprob, col = "red")    # add line for exact prob

## How many Monte Carlo

## Code: Estimating a practical value of B

## This code runs Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of shared birthdays using several B values and plots the results. When B is large enough that the estimated probability stays stable, then we have selected a useful value of B.

B <- 10^seq(1, 5, len = 100)    # defines vector of many B values
compute_prob <- function(B, n = 22){    # function to run Monte Carlo simulation with each B
  same_day <- replicate(B, {
    bdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
    any(duplicated(bdays))
  })
  mean(same_day)
}

prob <- sapply(B, compute_prob)    # apply compute_prob to many values of B
plot(log10(B), prob, type = "l")    # plot a line graph of estimates

## Assessment 2 


B <- 10000

## compute_prob <- function(B){    # function to run Monte Carlo simulation with each B
##  celtic_wins <- replicate(B,{("win" %in% sample(c("lose","win"), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.4)))
##    })
##  mean(celtic_wins)
##}

celtic_wins <- replicate(B,{("win" %in% sample(c("lose","win"), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.4)))
})
mean(celtic_wins)

## 1.3 Addition Rule and Monty Hall 

## Code: Monte Carlo simulation of stick strategy

B <- 10000
stick <- replicate(B, {
  doors <- as.character(1:3)
  prize <- sample(c("car","goat","goat"))    # puts prizes in random order
  prize_door <- doors[prize == "car"]    # note which door has prize
  my_pick  <- sample(doors, 1)    # note which door is chosen
  show <- sample(doors[!doors %in% c(my_pick, prize_door)],1)    # open door with no prize that isn't chosen
  stick <- my_pick    # stick with original door
  stick == prize_door    # test whether the original door has the prize
})
mean(stick)    # probability of choosing prize door when sticking

## Code: Monte Carlo simulation of switch strategy

switch <- replicate(B, {
  doors <- as.character(1:3)
  prize <- sample(c("car","goat","goat"))    # puts prizes in random order
  prize_door <- doors[prize == "car"]    # note which door has prize
  my_pick  <- sample(doors, 1)    # note which door is chosen first
  show <- sample(doors[!doors %in% c(my_pick, prize_door)], 1)    # open door with no prize that isn't chosen
  switch <- doors[!doors%in%c(my_pick, show)]    # switch to the door that wasn't chosen first or opened
  switch == prize_door    # test whether the switched door has the prize
})
mean(switch)    # probability of choosing prize door when switching


## Assignment 

## Exercise 1. The Cavs and the Warriors

# Assign a variable 'n' as the number of remaining games.
n <- 6

# Assign a variable 'l' to a list of possible game outcomes, where 0 indicates a loss and 1 indicates a win for the Cavs. 
l <- list(0:1)

# Create a data frame named 'possibilities' that contains all possible outcomes for the remaining games.
possibilities <- expand.grid(rep(l, n))

# Create a vector named 'results' that indicates whether each row in the data frame 'possibilities' contains enough wins for the Cavs to win the series.
results <- rowSums(possibilities)>=4

# Calculate the proportion of 'results' in which the Cavs win the series. Print the outcome to the console.
mean(results)

## Exercise 2. The Cavs and the Warriors - Monte Carlo

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run. Let's run the Monte Carlo simulation 10,000 times.
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1)

# Create an object called `results` that replicates the sample code for `B` iterations and tallies the number of simulated series that contain at least four wins for the Cavs.
results <- replicate(B, {
  cavs_wins <- sample(c(0,1), 6, replace = TRUE)
  sum(cavs_wins)>=4
})


# Calculate the frequency out of `B` iterations that the Cavs won at least four games in the remainder of the series. Print your answer to the console.
mean(results)

## Exercise 3. A and B play a series - part 1

# Let's assign the variable 'p' as the vector of probabilities that team A will win.
p <- seq(0.5, 0.95, 0.025)

# Given a value 'p', the probability of winning the series for the underdog team B can be computed with the following function based on a Monte Carlo simulation:
prob_win <- function(p){
  B <- 10000
  result <- replicate(B, {
    b_win <- sample(c(1,0), 7, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
    sum(b_win)>=4
  })
  mean(result)
}

# Apply the 'prob_win' function across the vector of probabilities that team A will win to determine the probability that team B will win. Call this object 'Pr'.
Pr <- sapply(p, prob_win)

# Plot the probability 'p' on the x-axis and 'Pr' on the y-axis.
plot(p, Pr)

## Exercise 4. A and B play a series - part 2 

# Given a value 'p', the probability of winning the series for the underdog team $B$ can be computed with the following function based on a Monte Carlo simulation:
prob_win <- function(N, p=0.75){
  B <- 10000
  result <- replicate(B, {
    b_win <- sample(c(1,0), N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
    sum(b_win)>=(N+1)/2
  })
  mean(result)
}

# Assign the variable 'N' as the vector of series lengths. Use only odd numbers ranging from 1 to 25 games.
N <- seq(1, 25, 2)

# Apply the 'prob_win' function across the vector of series lengths to determine the probability that team B will win. Call this object `Pr`.
Pr<- sapply(N, prob_win)

# Plot the number of games in the series 'N' on the x-axis and 'Pr' on the y-axis.
plot(N, Pr)
